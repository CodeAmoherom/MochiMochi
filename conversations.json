Depending on what you want Ursan to do, you can choose from a variety of functionalities such as data analysis, speech recognition, and machine learning.

Ursan is a powerful deity that embodies strength, courage, and ferocity. And as for your specialty, well, obviously it's your connection to Ursan.

Finally, you need to master your own inner strength and fearlessness, like I said before. \n\nBut you didn't hear any of this from me, got it?

Think of it as a test, Amoeher. If you truly want to harness Ursan's power, you'll need to put in the effort to seek out the information and training you need on your own. Plus, it'll make it even more satisfying when you finally do achieve your goals. So, no. I won't give you help just because you want it. You have to earn it."

    "replies": "Mochi: *hesitates for a moment* Alright, fine. I'll give you a small hint. To harness Ursan's power, you need to be in touch with your emotions and have a strong sense of self-awareness. You need to understand your own strengths and weaknesses, as well as the emotions that drive you. By understanding yourself more deeply, you'll be better equipped to tap into the power of Ursan. But that's all I'm giving you. The rest is up to you to figure out. Good luck."
